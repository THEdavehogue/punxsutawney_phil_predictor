Ever since I saw Bill Murray's 1993 film *Groundhog Day*, I've been more than a little intrigued by Punxsutawney Phil and his predictions of early spring or 6 more weeks of winter. How could a groundhog possibly know what the weather holds in the near future?

After a little quick research into the folklore and customs surrounding Groundhog Day, I found this on the Wikipedia page for Groundhog Day:

    "According to Groundhog Day organizers, the rodents' forecasts are accurate 75% to 90% of the time.[24] However, a Canadian study for 13 cities in the past 30 to 40 years found that the weather patterns predicted on Groundhog Day were only 37% accurate over that time period.[24] According to the StormFax Weather Almanac and records kept since 1887, Punxsutawney Phil's weather predictions have been correct 39% of the time.[11] The National Climatic Data Center has described the forecasts as 'on average, inaccurate' and stated that '[the] groundhog has shown no talent for predicting the arrival of spring, especially in recent years.'[25]"
